## Assignments

### Assignment 1:
An IPv4 address is a numeric identifier that a device uses to communicate on the internet, akin to a postal address in the real world, typically formatted in dot-decimal notation as `#.#.#.#`. But each `#` should be a number between `0` and `255`, inclusive. Suffice it to say `275` is not in that range! If only NUMB3RS had validated the address in that scene!
In a file called `assignment1.py`, implement a function called `validate` that expects an IPv4 address as input as a `str` and then returns `True` or `False`, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.

__NOTE__ :
Structure `assignment1.py` as in the assignment1.py , wherein you’re welcome to modify `main` and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use `re` and/or `sys`

### Assignment 2:

### Assignment 3:
In a file called `assignment3.py`, implement a function called `count` that expects a line of text as input as a `str` and returns, as an `int`, the number of times that “um” appears in that text, case-insensitively, as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. For instance, given text like `hello, um, world`, the function should return 1. Given text like `yummy`, though, the function should return `0`.

__NOTE__ :
Structure `assignment3.py`, wherein you’re welcome to modify `main` and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use `re` and/or `sys`
